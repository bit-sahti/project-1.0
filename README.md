#Blackjack

##About

This game was developed with Vanilla Javascrip, CSS and HTML as the final project of Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp.

##Game Rules

The goal of the game is to achieve 21 or come as close as possible. If you have a 21, you will win 1.5 times the amount you have betted. If you don't have it, but you're hand is still higher than the dealer's hand, you will win the same as the betted amount.

After receiving your two cards, you may ask for as many as you like, but beware! If you surpass 21, you will go bust and lose the betted amount.The same will happen if the dealer's hand is closer to 21 than yours.

If both you and the dealer have the same total, it's a push. You win and lose nothing.

As it is costummary, the dealer must stand on a soft 17.
